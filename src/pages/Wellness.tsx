                Wellness is not just about physical health—it's about creating harmony between body, mind, and spirit. 
                In our fast-paced world, taking time to nurture ourselves isn't a luxury; it's essential for sustainable living.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through thoughtful self-care practices, we can build resilience, improve our relationships, enhance our 
                productivity, and ultimately, live more fulfilling lives. Whether it's through nutrition, movement, 
                meditation, or simply learning to rest, every small step toward wellness counts.
